### overview

This ePortfolio integrates the acquired knowledge and skills developed throughout the academic years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I have been in the computer science program since August 2018. Throughout the program, I have consistently been practicing my coding and programming skills to demonstrate my ability to code securely by adopting SEI CERT secure coding standards to ensure applications software is safeguarded against vulnerabilities, errors, and bugs. Over the years, I developed coding best practices to ensure codes are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Moreover, I expanded my skill set to become proficient in diverse programming languages. This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate my background and give an overview of what I accomplished throughout the SNHU Computer Science Program. Furthermore, it illustrated the skills and concepts learned in various languages to develop software that adheres to the coding standards to eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities.

##### Self-reflections
[Journal: self-Introduction](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Journal1-1.docx)

I work as a Senior Manufacturing Engineering Technician for Bose Corporation. Before working for the company, I had planned to pursue a career in electrical Engineering, but with my work hours and schedule, I could not attend class in person. So, I decided to enroll in SNHU's online Computer Science Program concentrated on Software Engineering. Simply put, I started in the Computer Science Program in August 2018 as a part-time student, having studied in the program for as long as five years. Before enrolling in the program, I studied Computer Networking, but I did not complete the program. Since I am fascinated with understanding how computers work, Computer Science/Software engineering is the perfect program to understand what's going on behind the scenes of a computer. Consequently, I decided to enroll in the program simply because the idea of telling a machine to perform a task or to be more precise to write code in some language for an application to execute and follow each step to accomplish a goal is astonishing.

[Journal: Career Choice](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Journal4-1.docx)

Throughout the Computer Science Program, I have learned valuable skills that position me to the top marketable career that significantly projected growth rate faster than all other occupations nationwide (Kathleen, 2023). These skills that I learned from the computer science program will be added to my portfolio to boost my chances of employment. When I reflect on my previous experience, I see where I can enhance these skills to apply to multiple industries. With that said, a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science opens doors to exciting and lucrative professional opportunities in software development, computer programming, software engineering, and database administration that make the investment worthwhile (Kathleen, 2023).

[Journal: Marketing with ePortfolio and artifact Update](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Journal3-1.docx)

In this paper, I use the ePortfolio as a vehicle for formative assessment of my accomplishments by connecting my experiences and knowledge gained through my academic years and workplace performance.

# ePortfolio Selection
[Initial Plan](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/ePortfolio1-4.docx)

This assignment is an initial plan to follow through with the ePortfolio and demonstrate my skills in three categories within computer science: software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and Databases. This plan is a way to start a discussion and propose enhancements to refine the three categories of artifacts.

- Software Engineering and Design
* Algorithms and data Structures
+ databases

# Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
[Software Design and Engineering Narrative](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Milestone3-2.docx)

This paragraph is a narrative that accompanies the artifact, which aligns with the category of software design and engineering. The enhancement of the artifact selected demonstrates my proficiency, knowledge, and skills in implementing techniques to complete a polished project and the ability to solve complex problems in the software development process. This paper explains why the selected artifact was chosen and demonstrates my ability to use collaborative tools and techniques to implement the project to solve logical problems and address security flaws and defects embedded in software design early in development. Thus far, the goal is to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

# ALgorithms and Data Structures Enhancement
[Algorithms and Data Structures Narrative](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Milestone4-2.docx)

The artifact is a binary search tree that accommodates several methods, which manage the creation of a search tree, insertion of nodes, deletion of nodes, and searching and displaying specified nodes. The objective of the artifact was to allocate resources to an acceptable performance to ensure that the best possible performance was being achieved. Speaking of enhancing the artifact, I chose the selected artifact because an understanding of complex data structures and algorithms is extremely helpful in situations where it is necessary to complete a task in a short amount of time with efficiency and using fewer resources. Moreover, It is necessary when searching and sorting through data tables to analyze interesting instances and solve real-life problems that companies are faced.

# Databases Enhancement
[databases Narrative](https://github.com/Deandrey5000/Deandrey5000.github.io/blob/master/CS-499/Milestone5-2.docx)

The artifact is part of developing a web application that connects a client-side user interface to the Mongo database. The project develops a python framework that enables CRUD functionality to interact with the Mongo database. As illustrated, the selected artifact demonstrates a solid understanding of Python language and the integration of the MongoDB database through the implementation of Pymongo and MongoClient to allow the mongo database to interact with the dashboard. Moreover, it demonstrates the ability to implement a dashing table that provides access to large datasets and imports the CSV datasets from a CSV file to MongoDB.

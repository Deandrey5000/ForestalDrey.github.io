			  <p>This ePortfolio integrates the acquired knowledge and skills developed throughout the academic years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). I have been in the computer science program since August 2018. Throughout the program, I have consistently been practicing my coding and programming skills to demonstrate my ability to code securely by adopting SEI CERT secure coding standards to ensure applications software is safeguarded against vulnerabilities, errors, and bugs. Over the years, I developed coding best practices to ensure codes are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Moreover, I expanded my skill set to become proficient in diverse programming languages. This ePortfolio is designed to demonstrate my background and give an overview of what I accomplished throughout the SNHU Computer Science Program. Furthermore, it illustrated the skills and concepts learned in various languages to develop software that adheres to the coding standards to eliminate security risks and vulnerabilities.</p>

		  <p>While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned to understand C/C++ structure and algorithms, SQL and NoSQL databases, SEI CERT secure coding standards to mitigate security vulnerabilities, design and develop apps with Android, and collaboration to improve team productivity. Moreover, I learned about agile methodology and the software development life cycle and workflow, which primarily focused on flexibility, fast pace, and continuous improvement to deliver the best quality product possible. These learning experiences will be pragmatic and put into actionable steps to develop software securely. In the future, the knowledge acquired will allow me to build better apps, software, tools, databases, and websites that will offer consumers an improved user experience.</p>
		  <p>During my years studying Computer Science at SNHU, I grew tremendously in the program, from having any programming experience to gaining the knowledge to develop high-quality outcomes and design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. Moreover, I learn to use collaborative tools and employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. </p>
		  <p>I started in the Computer Science Program in August 2018 as a part-time student, having studied in the program for as long as five years. Before enrolling in the program, I studied Computer Networking, but I did not complete the program. During those years, I have learned and improved my coding skills, debugging, and troubleshooting block of code that terminates program execution abruptly because of logical errors. Since I am fascinated with understanding how computers work, Computer Science/Software engineering is the perfect program to understand what’s going on in the front-end and back-end of a computer system.</p>
		  <p>While in the computer Science Program, I have gained the skills, knowledge, and abilities to code in diverse programming languages, which is important to have the flexibility to work between languages, syntax, and semantics. Moreover, I developed a tester mindset and a security mindset to test and integrate application security into the software development life cycle as early as possible is an essential best practice to protect software from a security vulnerability that could lead to a security breach. In order words, “don’t leave security to the end” and test every iteration help to detect vulnerabilities and mitigate attacks as early as possible in the development process.</p>
		  <p>The DevOps process and infrastructure related to code reviews and coding standards best practices. By integrating security measures into each step of the DevOps process and infrastructure, DevOps becomes an automated process for the integration of security at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery. DevOps practices and Agile aim to reduce security flaws at the beginning of the development life cycle by performing security tests early and often. Similarly, The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) integrates application and infrastructure security processes and tools. It addresses security issues as they emerge before they introduce into production. By then, they are easier, faster, and less expensive to fix. Moreover, it enables "software, safer, sooner" by automating secure software delivery without slowing the software development cycle.</p>
		  <p>Thinking with a security mindset and not leaving it to the end is a way to gain a "zero trust" approach that improves my coding skills. Combining code reviews and a security mindset has helped me to discover bugs from modifying branches and analyze a team member’s code by identifying bugs, logic errors, style, test cases, consistency, performance, and unreachable call from breaking the source code. However, code review can be tedious, but incorporating it into the development lifecycle can result in positive outcomes. This approach helps me to engage and deliver the best quality codes that adhere to code best practices.</p>
		  <p>Throughout the program, I have learned to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. All these skills have improved during my years of study at SNHU. With that said, the program instills the necessary tools to follow my future endeavors. Because of that confidence, I am targeting to specialize in Software Engineering with the ability to develop, design, and create innovative application solutions to solve real-world problems and help clients and organization to deliver the product vision with the highest outcome. As a future developer, I enjoy working with computers to develop applications that focus primarily on flexibility, fast pace, and continuous improvement to deliver the best quality product possible. It is equally important to consider myself a future developer with strong analytical skills to solve problems by applying engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build application solutions for end users.</p>

		  <a id="ePortfolio considerations:" href="#content">ePortfolio Considerations.</a>
		  <p>Throughout the program, I developed a Computer Science mindset and learned Computer Science fundamentals and its methods. The fundamental understanding of those methods and principles allows me to enhance applications I did not know I could comprehend. Each of the principles or courses has impacted and helped to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to secure a position in the Computer Science field.</p>
		  <p>To prepare for the artifact's enhancement, I chose courses that their content is relevant to and that have impacted the development of the artifacts. First, the IT-145 foundation in application development teaches me the four pillars of Object-Oriented programming in Java. IT-145 Object Oriented Programming in Java helps to refine the code for the Basic life control view application. CS-250 shows me the importance of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) with Agile methodology. CS-260 Algorithms and Data Structures allow me to explore data structures and algorithms using a binary search tree to load bids from a CSV file. These courses acquiesce me to showcase my design approach and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles, computer science practices, and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</p>
		  <p>The chosen three artifacts for the code review demonstrate my growth in the categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The selected artifacts are projects from previous courses work in the Computer Science program, in which I enhanced the artifacts to improve their quality, address their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigate vulnerabilities</p>

		  <p>Utilizing an ePortfolio in terms of the benefits of self-promotion and marketing showcases one's competence development. It indicates a positive impact and provides valuable contributions to one's self-competence. It demonstrates one's performance as a process of action and results. Furthermore, it exhibits the self-condition performance of a potential employer and evaluates this condition of one's readiness to take over individual responsibilities. In this paper, I use the ePortfolio as a vehicle for formative assessment of my accomplishments by connecting my experiences and knowledge gained through my academic years and workplace performance.</p>
		  <p>Throughout the Computer Science Program, I have learned valuable skills that position me to the top marketable career that significantly projected growth rate faster than all other occupations nationwide (Kathleen, 2023). These skills that I learned from the computer science program will be added to my portfolio to boost my chances of employment. When reflecting on my previous experience, I see where I can enhance these skills to apply to multiple industries. Given this, a bachelor's degree in computer science opens doors to exciting and lucrative professional opportunities in software development, computer programming, software engineering, and database administration that make the investment worthwhile (Kathleen, 2023).</p>
		  <p>Following the above train of thought and my research on computer science career opportunities, my choice of career and plans for the future have not changed; on the contrary, it remains more consistent because the widespread of computer use, boundless opportunities, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) "projects jobs for computer and information technology occupations will grow significantly – a 15% increase – from 2021 to 2023 (BLS). This trajectory growth makes the investment in computer science worthwhile. Given this point, computer science has become essential to everyday life and changed nearly every aspect of society; therefore, the computer science field is the future career opportunity to be part of because the knowledge of programming languages goes a long way in making me eligible for multiple positions, such as a computer programmer, web developer or a software engineer. </p>

		  <a id="Refinement Plan and Code Review:" href="#content">Refinement Plan and Code Review.</a>
		  <p>As a Computer Science Professional, I understand that code reviews are an excellent approach to discovering bugs from modifying branches. This approach helps me to engage and deliver the best quality codes that adhere to code best practices. However, no matter how effective the coding process is. There will always be room for mistakes. To address these mistakes, I must understand comments are a technical way to help me to grow and make better coding decisions rather than hinder them. Therefore, I do not take the comments personally and integrate the techniques that make the codes more appealing. Also, these comments are a way to ensure I follow guidelines and best practices. When reviewing code, it is extremely important to write translucent comments that address specific issues to avoid misleading the development-based team on a wild goose chase. This way, I can easily pinpoint the problem and implement a fix that binds to the code standard.</p>
		  <p>To ensure that I have done my due diligence properly, using a checklist has proven to be a very efficient method to satisfy the reviewing requirements. As part of my due diligence, I ensure that each modified code is committed with a meaningful comment that describes the purpose of the changes, annotated, and well documented so that the reviewer understands the code logic; moreover, I incorporated case tests and ran unit tests to ensure the code is running and passes all unit test.</p>
		  <p>While altering the artifacts, all new feature branches and unit tests are developed separately to prevent errors from polluting the codebase. Since the artifacts are subject to code review before pushing changes upstream, I reviewed all changes accordingly to eliminate any obvious mistakes. When I felt comfortable that the codes were working as designed, I pulled from upstream to have the latest update, and then I pushed the code to upstream to be reviewed.</p>

		  <a id="Software Design and Engineering:" href="#content">Software Design and Engineering.</a>
		  <p>This paragraph is a narrative that accompanies the artifact, which aligns with the category of software design and engineering. The enhancement of the artifact selected demonstrates my proficiency, knowledge, and skills in implementing techniques to complete a polished project and the ability to solve complex problems in the software development process. This paper explains why the selected artifact is chosen and demonstrates my ability to use collaborative tools and techniques to implement the project to solve logical problems and address security flaws and defects embedded in software design early in development. Thus far, the goal is to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</p>
		  <p>The original artifact contains many markers that indicate safety type that can lead to potential exploitation. With these safety types, the code executes successfully without crashing the program. As the code runs, the code compiles normally, and there are no trapped runtime errors or any conditional statements halting the execution of the code at any given point. Given this point, enhance the code as necessary. First, I added a suppress warning to clear the marker to the top destination list. Next, as for the default list model, JList label, and the remaining questionable lines, I parameterized them to clear the markers since there were crude state-type references to a generic type of variables name. Second, I wrote a comment for each line of code to explain the code logic. Last, to ensure unauthorized users cannot access the program without validating their credentials. I implemented two Java classes that ask users to enter their credentials. In doing so, I created an authentication class that stored a user ID and password that was not sent to a server to be validated. Next, a login page class contained the logic to validate the user ID and password. Then, import both Java classes in the main function to be invoked. When the login page opens, the user clicks the login button and enters the user ID and password to access resources. If they match, then an alert dialog is shown, and the page reloads; otherwise, it displays an error message. Unfortunately, the login page is not working as expected because I wanted it to execute first and then ask the users to enter their credentials before the top destination list JPanel opens. </p>
		  <p>While modifying the artifact, I learned that enhancing the artifact not only revolving logical problems or security defects but researching documentation to apply to appropriate APIs and libraries for the corresponding language. With the project's implementations, I am strengthening my skills by integrating components to develop practical techniques to accomplish the goal.</p>

		    <p>The artifact is a binary search tree that accommodates several methods, which manage the creation of a search tree, insertion of nodes, deletion of nodes, and searching and displaying specified nodes. The objective of the artifact was to allocate resources to an acceptable performance to ensure that the best possible performance was being achieved. Speaking of enhancing the artifact, I chose the selected artifact because an understanding of complex data structures and algorithms is extremely helpful in situations where it is necessary to complete a task in a short amount of time with efficiency and using fewer resources. Moreover, it is necessary when searching and sorting through data tables to analyze interesting instances and solve real-life problems that companies are faced with.</p>
		    <p>Knowledge of data structures and algorithms like binary search trees goes a long way in solving problems efficiently. Therefore, demonstrating my proficiency, knowledge, and skills in implementing techniques to complete a polished project and the ability to solve complex problems is one step to securing an interview because employers are interested in a candidate who can apply various algorithms and tools to solve a given challenge. This paper explains why the selected artifact was chosen and demonstrates my ability to use collaborative tools and techniques to implement the project to solve the given problem like binary trees to add and remove data from the structure.</p>
		    <p>Completing the project refinement has made it clear that an understanding of data structures and algorithms, their capabilities, and limitations is key to success in solving real-world problems. With that said, a similar technique was applied to improve the artifact. For example, a binary search trees technique was implemented to facilitate the use of resources at its minimum and increase performance to search the structure for data.</p>
		    <p>While modifying the artifact, I faced a challenge I had never encountered before. To overcome the challenge, I continuously research stack overflow and open-source communities websites to find a fix for the CSV parser fetal error file or directory not found. The challenge was; when the CSVparser.hpp file was invoked, the file content was not displayed. When looking at the CSVparser.cpp, the included library is included. To resolve the fatal error, I copied the CSVparser.hpp as a text file and replaced the original file with the text file. Unfortunately, the problem persisted. Thinking the CSV file may be outdated, I updated the file with the newest version of CSV. This time the marker from the CSVparser.cpp is gone, but the compiler still reported a fatal error: CSVparser.hpp file or directory not found. When clicking on the run project as a local C/C++ application, the application launcher opens with an error message: launch failed: binary not found. To this point, I think the Eclipse IDE environment is configured incorrectly. So, I clicked on Windows> preferences to resolve the launch error. From there, I modified the built environment and makeFile project binary parser set up to PE windows parser, then ran configurations. The issue is still not Resolved. Ultimately, I decided to verify if project properties > run/debug setting and under launch, configuration contained the project executable. If so, I can edit it to point to the location of the executable. The issue is still not Resolved. To this end, I Verified the project properties to ensure the C/C++ build GCC compiler linker was configured properly. Surprisingly, the GCC compiler setting was not configured correctly. I configured the GCC compiler setting, and the project executed as expected. </p>
		    <p>While working on the project's implementations, I benefited greatly from this research by strengthening my skills and integrating components to develop practical techniques to accomplish the goal. Furthermore, I have developed an understanding of how data structures and algorithms will help me in my future endeavors. </p>

			  <p>The artifact is part of developing a web application that connects a client-side user interface to the Mongo database. The project develops a Python framework that enables CRUD functionality to interact with the Mongo database. As illustrated, the selected artifact demonstrates a solid understanding of Python language and the integration of the MongoDB database through the implementation of Pymongo and MongoClient to allow the Mongo database to interact with the dashboard. Moreover, it demonstrates the ability to implement a dashing table that provides access to large datasets and imports the CSV datasets from a CSV file to MongoDB.</p>
			  <p>The dashboard development uses the Dash framework to interact with the Mongo database and to connect the client-side user interface to Mongo. The dashboard interactive module clue the frameworks to facilitate interaction between Mongo and Python. For the client-facing web application to interact with Mongo, several component libraries were imported to allow communication among the frameworks. In order words, understanding and exploring how the dash core, HTML components, and callbacks work to produce an efficient and straightforward coding structure are the components that demonstrate my skills and abilities to connect the dashboard AIP with Jupyter Notebook.</p>
			  <p>To complete the required functionality for this project, I created a full stack development application using Python language, Jupiter notebook platform, and MongoDB for the user to access the Mongo database. In doing so, Pymongo imports MongoClient to allow the Mongo database to interact with the dashboard. Moreover, I ensure the application has a user-friendly client-facing web application dashboard that integrates the dash core components to facilitate access to many interactive components.</p>
			  <p>This paper explains why the selected artifact is chosen and demonstrates my ability to develop a web application that connects a client-side user interface to the Mongo database. Meeting the course objectives planned to refine the artifact demonstrates my proficiency, knowledge, and skills in implementing techniques to complete a polished project, and the ability to solve complex problems is one step to securing an interview because employers are interested in a candidate who can apply various tools to solve a given challenge. </p>
			  <p>As previously mentioned, the artifact was developed in the Apporto environment, to which I previously had access. To get the artifact up and running, I started the artifact from scratch on my local computer. In doing so, I download all the necessary Mongo database tools to develop a Python module file through Jupyter Notebook. In Jupyter Notebook, an object-oriented methodology is used to create and read functionality for the Mongo database. On the positive side, setting up the Mongo database framework was time-consuming, but my efforts paid off because I could successfully connect Jupyter Notebook with the Mongo client and imported the animal shelter csv file from my local computer to the Mongo database. For the most part, I had to fix multiple errors like module named not found error (dash_leaflet, jupyter_plotly_dash, dash, dash_table, and pandas) when running the project. To resolve these errors, from the jupyter command line, I installed the module needed to clear the faults. While running the project, I encountered a failed authentication because the Mongo shell could not connect to the server after installing the Mongo client components. The Mongo server network lost communication. In Windows 10, the control panel ->system and security->administration tools->services. I searched for mongoDB and clicked on start to connect Mongo shell to the Mongo server network.</p>
